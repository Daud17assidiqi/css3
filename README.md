## Features

CSS3 introduced a variety of new features and improvements over its predecessor, CSS2. Some notable features include:

- **Flexbox**: A layout model that allows the design of complex layouts and distribution of space among items in a container even when their size is unknown or dynamic.

- **Grid Layout**: A two-dimensional layout system for the web that enables the creation of complex web designs more efficiently.

- **Transitions and Animations**: CSS3 allows the creation of smooth transitions and animations without the need for JavaScript or Flash.

- **Media Queries**: With media queries, styles can be applied based on characteristics of the device, such as its screen resolution, device orientation, or display type.

- **Selectors**: CSS3 introduced several new selectors, offering more flexibility and control over styling elements.

## Getting Started

To use the CSS3 features in your project, you can link to the CSS file in your HTML document. For example:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
Make sure to include the appropriate CSS3 styles based on the features you want to use.
